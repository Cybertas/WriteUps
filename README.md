# WriteUps-HTB
WriteUps for HTB Labs, collection of machines that I will use to hone my skills.   
Difficulty ratings are subjective (x/10)<br>
Some writeups will contain POCs but highly recommend to get from source<br>
On my path to take on OSCP again, got 0/100 for my first attempt and i am extremely titled by the thought of it, CPTS will be my practice...
